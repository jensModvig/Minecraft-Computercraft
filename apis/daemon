    DFC - Daemons For Computers - 2013 Sangar

    This program is licensed under the MIT license.
    http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php

    This API provides daemons/services. Just drop them in the folder as
    configured in the daemonPath variable (default: /daemons). All scripts in
    that folder will be started when the API's install() function is called.
    It allows managing installed daemons, i.e. installing new ones, enabling
    and disabling existing ones, or removing them completely.

    Daemons should never interact with the terminal directly, since that would
    interfere with the currently running foreground program (say, the shell).
    For that reason the global write, print and printError functions are
    replaced with ones that write to a log file during the execution of the
    daemons.

    This API works by hijacking the global coroutine.resume() function. It will
    forward any calls to unknown threads as-is and will take care of filtering
    any events for the thread that installed the API, as well as the daemon
    threads. Note that while resuming any threads it will restore the actual
    coroutine.restore() function, to avoid recursion.
